## Frontend Performance Invariants

- Transcript rendering must preserve chunk-level performance boundaries. Do not flatten all entries for a turn in render paths, selectors, or display grouping unless the design explicitly justifies the bounded cost.
- UI-only features such as grouping, collapse, disclosure, or labels must not turn chunked transcript data back into full-turn arrays, and must not render every hidden entry while collapsed.
- Prefer chunk-level selectors and chunk-level React components for transcript hot paths. Unchanged chunks should keep stable selector results and avoid re-rendering old entries when new entries append to later chunks.
- Changes to transcript rendering or grouping must include regression coverage or an issue-note update that explains the performance impact.
